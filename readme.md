# JSON and File Upload with Single API using Spring Boot and Angular

This project demonstrates how to send both JSON data and a file in a single API request using Spring Boot as the backend and Angular as the frontend. The main goal is to showcase the ability to handle multipart form data that contains both a JSON object and a file upload in one API call.

## Key Features

- **Single API for JSON and File**: A RESTful API that accepts JSON and file uploads via a multipart form request.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Manages the incoming requests, processes the JSON data, and stores the file.
- **Angular Frontend**: Provides a user interface to select a file and input JSON data before submitting them together to the backend.
- **File Storage**: Stores the uploaded file locally or in a specified directory on the server.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Frontend**: Angular (TypeScript)
- **Communication**: REST API using multipart form data
